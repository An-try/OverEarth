  _description: Blast fragmentation warhead is designed to hit targets with a high-speed
    stream of fragments, formed when an explosive charge is detonated. It combines
    two damaging effects - fragmentation and high-explosive. They are one of the most
    common types of warheads. They are used to destroy almost all types of targets,
    except underwater, underground and heavily armored targets.
