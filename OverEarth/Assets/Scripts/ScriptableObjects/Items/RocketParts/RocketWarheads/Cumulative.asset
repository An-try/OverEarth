  _description: A warhead, the main damaging effect of which is based on a cumulative
    effect. During an explosion, a metal stream is formed, which is sent at a supersonic
    speed towards the target. It is used to destroy targets protected by armor or
    concrete (tanks, bunkers). The cumulative jet, pushing through the barrier, penetrates
    inside with its fragments, as well as fragments of the cladding or chipped pieces
    of armor, striking the crew and unarmored elements - fuel lines, tanks, ammunition.
