  _description: 'A nuclear warhead uses a nuclear charge. There are several types
    of such charges: nuclear (using uranium and plutonium), thermonuclear and their
    derivatives (neutron, x-ray charge). The main damaging effects of nuclear warheads
    are a shock wave, light radiation, penetrating radiation, an electromagnetic pulse
    and radioactive contamination. They have the most powerful destructive effect
    and are weapons of mass destruction. A huge drawback is radioactive contamination.'
